            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These Lemon Rosemary Grilled Chicken Breasts can go from 
                thoughts of "What's for dinner?" to dinner-on-the-table 
                and ready-to-eat in 30 minutes. If the chicken's still in 
                the freezer, it will take about 30 minutes longer, but 
                still quite do-able, even on a busy weeknight.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a food processor, blend butter, rosemary, garlic, 
                    lemon zest, and lemon juice together. Pour 1/3 of the 
                    blended mixture into a small bowl for marinade. 
                    Cover remaining mixture, and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lightly season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. 
                    Rub chicken breasts with marinade. Place chicken 
                    breasts on a platter, cover, and refrigerate for 3 
                    hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil 
                    the grate. Transfer half of the reserved rosemary and 
                    lemon mixture into a bowl for basting. Cover remaining 
                    mixture, and set aside for topping cooked chicken.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook chicken breasts on hot grill, basting with 
                    rosemary and lemon basting mixture, about 4 minutes 
                    per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
                    the center should read at least 165 degrees F 
                    (74 degrees C). Remove chicken breasts from the grill,
                    and top with remaining rosemary and lemon mixture.
